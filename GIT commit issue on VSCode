ERROR: Make sure you configure your 'user.name' and 'user.email' in git

When encountering a Git error during a commit in any IDE, ensure that you have configured your 'user.name' and 'user.email' in Git. Follow the troubleshooting steps below:

    Review the Error Message:
    Click on the log accompanying the Git error message first to get more details.

    Check Output Window in VS Code:
    If you are using VS Code, locate the error message with read-only options in the 'output' window.

    Copy Error Details to Notepad:
    Copy both the 'user.email' and 'user.name' error messages and paste them into Notepad for reference.

    Configure User Email:
    Run the following command in the terminal:

git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address. If using VS Code, execute the command in the integrated terminal. If using WSL, run the command in the path where Git is configured.

Configure User Name:
Run the following command in the terminal:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name. Git uses the username to identify the contributor, not for authentication.

     

Confirm Configuration:
Ensure that there are no error messages after completing the above steps.

Run Commit in IDE:
Proceed to commit your changes in the IDE.
